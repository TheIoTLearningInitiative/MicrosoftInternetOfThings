# Architecting the Internet of Things

> This session will give a brief overview of what IoT is from the perspective of an Architect within Consulting Services. We will look at what kinds of projects we are getting involved in, what those projects look like in reality, the kinds of challenges you will face, the network you need to succeed, and the risks involved. This session will move beyond hypotheticals and introduce real world examples that will help you prepare for life as a delivery architect working with IoT.

> Collecting information from lots of devices is cool - but it is just __telematics__. Merging perspectives between devices, systems, and humans to build a better understanding of the world around us. But tying together __insight__ with __action__ - there lies the promise of IoT. 

Objectives

- Understand what IoT means for IT Architects
- Learn the tecnologies and how to begin applying  them to deliver a modern IoT project
- Be better able to talk to Customers about IoT

Session Overview

- What is IoT and why it is important
- IoT from an Architect's perspective
- Technologies Architects need to know
- Common pattern and practices
- Quick real world examples

Expectations

- Level 200 Architecture Session
- There will be no code
- There will be no "flashing light" demos

## IoT: The Internet of Things

> The network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate  and interact with their external states or the external environment. Gartner Definition

> 20 billion devices by 2020. Gartner

### What is it?

- Unique objects connected to the Internet
- Devices, not people
- Bi-directional communication
- Large, complex data flows
- New types of insight
